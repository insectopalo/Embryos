   ========
   is a very simple genetic algorithm implementation for a toy model. The
   organisms are n-bits computer words. The fitness function is the number of
   ones in the word.
   The population is produced by initializing m words randomly. Then
   iteratively evaluate the fitness of each vector, keep the b vectors with the
   highest values of it and apply 1-point corssover to these, producing b new
   words -the parents are chosen randomly, there's no competition-. The new b
   words substitute the bottom b words in the fitness-sorted population.
   Break the loop when bmax generations have been run or when a word reaches a
   fitness of 1.

   HOW TO USE IT
   It is rather simple: change the #define section with the desired values,
   compile and run. Change the program to suit your needs.
