   educational or recreational purposes. I always keep feeling that one day
   these little programs might become useful in a way, at least for myself.

     Genetic algorithm toy model implementation. Have a look to the readme
     in the folder. It is a very short and easy-to-understand implementation
     in C following the instructions of the tutorial 8 of the Artificial
     Intelligence course from the University of Otago.
